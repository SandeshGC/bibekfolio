            Online banking and payment system has been especially helpful during the COVID pandemic as it helped us to maintain social distancing. During this lockdown, online gaming and OTT platforms have been a source of entertainment. Computers are being used in every sector such as banks, governmental offices, scientific research, weather forecasting and so on to keep tabs on their record, performing statistics, analysing raw data and even predicting outcomes with the help of AI. Technologies have been a blessing in human development. It can even change human evolution and the natural cycle, depending on how we plan to sustain it.

            Within our progressive livelihood, there are some sectors in our society where some technologies are misused or implemented badly. Recently, India has announced a ban on social media sites like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. unless they approve and implement the policies announced by Indian Ministry of Information. Those apps that were used to communicate among people all over the world, are sometimes used for misdeeds such as harassment, cyber bullying, illegal trading, hacking, etc. These big-tech giants have been selling our private data to international traders for advertisement. The satellites have taken us to the moon and made us able to explore Mars, while some organisations are using it just to control their military and spy on other countries. Our life isn't threatened only by physical means but endangered on digital medium as well.

            Therefore, while technology has helped us advance to a new age it also has held us back due to its exploitation. Thus, we can conclude that technology has been a major part of daily life by assisting in our daily needs also it has been deeply rooted in our life such that life without technology may not be possible at all.
